// Originally, I repurposed the 3dmol.js parser for when plugins need to access
// information about atoms. But I came to realize that this is overkill. I'm now
// going to create a minimal parser for PDB and MOL2 files instead, since these
// are the formats that molmoda uses internally for protein and compound files,
// respectively. It doens't need to have a lot of functionality. It just needs
// to be light on memory.
