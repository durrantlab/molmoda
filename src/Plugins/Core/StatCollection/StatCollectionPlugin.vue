                We use cookies to store user settings and collect usage
                statistics via Google Analytics (GA). Tracking usage helps us

                work relies on.

                We'll never use GA to record your molecular structures or
                analyses. GA only gathers basic user data like tracking IDs, IP
                addresses, and device details. This data is sent to Google in
                the U.S. for processing and so is subject to U.S. law.
