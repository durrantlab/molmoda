# MolModa 1.0.0

Molecular docking advances early-stage drug discovery by predicting the
geometries and affinities of small-molecule compounds bound to drug-target
receptors, predictions that researchers can leverage in prioritizing drug
candidates for experimental testing. MolModa provides a secure, accessible
environment where users can perform molecular docking entirely in the their web
browsers.
